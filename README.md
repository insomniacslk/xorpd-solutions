[This page is accessible at [https://insomniacslk.github.io/xorpd-solutions/](https://insomniacslk.github.io/xorpd-solutions/)]

This repository documents my solutions to the riddles proposed by
[xorpd](https://xorpd.net) in their book [`[xchg rax,rax]`](https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html). The book contains advanced x86 ASM riddles and it is a fun reading for anyone interested in x86 assembly.

I had a list of solutions on my home page [https://insomniac.slackware.it](https://insomniac.slackware.it)
a few
years ago, but the content got lost, and various people asked me if I still had
them. Unfortunately I don't, so I decided to solve them again and document them
here.

There are other solutions to this book's riddles, for example
[Raptor's xorpd-solutions](https://github.com/0xdea/xorpd-solutions), which I
highly recommend to read. The difference from this repo is that I take an
educational approach to help newcomers understand the riddles and hopefully
learn something new and fun :)

You can start with the first riddle at [0x00](0x00), or see the full list below.
I recommend keeping an x86 ASM reference handy, for example https://c9x.me/x86/ .
Happy reversing!
